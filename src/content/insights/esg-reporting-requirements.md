## The New Landscape of ESG Reporting

Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) reporting has moved from voluntary disclosure to regulatory requirement for many companies. Understanding these obligations is essential for compliance and stakeholder relations.

### Key Developments

- **SEC Climate Rules**: Phased implementation of climate-related financial disclosures
- **EU CSRD**: Extraterritorial reach affecting US companies with EU operations
- **Investor Expectations**: Growing demand for standardized, comparable ESG data

### Preparing Your Organization

Start with a gap assessment to understand your current reporting capabilities versus emerging requirements. Build cross-functional teams spanning finance, operations, and sustainability.
